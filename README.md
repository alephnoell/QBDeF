# Very General QBF Generator (VGG)
A very general generator to create QBF instances in popular formats given the formal definition of a family of formulas.

# Description
This repository contains the material realted to the project of developing a program capable of reading formal definitions of QBF formulae families to generate actual instances in popular formats such as QCIR o QDIMACS.

Formula family defintions are written in a formal language parsed by the generator, which then outputs an actual instance in a valid format for some values of the family's parameters.

# Contents

* `/progress_documentation`: documents containing information about the development of the project.
* `/references`: some of the articles used for the documentation of the project.
